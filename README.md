# Memory Card Game

This is a Memory Card Game application made for "The Odin Project". For this project, I created a Memory card game in reactJS with the use of react hooks, the pokeapi database, and the pokeapi-js-wrapper package. One possible future improvement to the application would be to fetch/load the data for all 151 cards before the user begins the game to reduce the number of api fetches done.
